# STREET-LIGHT-MONITORING-SYSTEM 
The aim of automated streetlight management system using IOT is the conservation of energy by
reducing electricity wastage as well as to reduce the manpower. Streetlights are the elemental
part of any city since it facilitates better night visions, secure roads, and exposure to
public areas but it consumes a quite large proportion of electricity. In the manual streetlight
system lights its powered from sunset to sunrise with maximum intensity even when there is 
sufficient light available. This energy wastage can be avoided by switching off lights
automatically. The saved energy can be efficiently utilized for other purposes like residential,
commercial, transportation etc. This can be achieved using an IOT enabled streetlight management
system. The project uses Light Emitting Diodes (LED) that do not consume an enormous amount of 
electricity to replace the power consuming traditional HID lamps. LED lights along with LDR 
enables the intensity variation which is infeasible with the HID lamps. As LEDs are directional 
light sources it can emit light in specific direction thereby optimizing the efficiency of the 
streetlights. This work is implemented using a programmed Arduino board for providing the required
intensity of light at various times.
